# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
* This final lesson was the most challenging.  Quite frankly, I used all my resources to finally navigate it.  I do not feel comfortable without going over this at least FIVE more times ...over the next 2 weeks.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
* Workflow has improved.  However, time management is constant challenge.  Being flexible and adaptable are the keys for me.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
* I need to go through every lesson, TWICE...over the next three weeks and print out all of the key lesson parts...and practice coding daily in order to be more confident for Mod 1.  I am up to the task and have already planned to do these things with Jedeo.  Thanks.
